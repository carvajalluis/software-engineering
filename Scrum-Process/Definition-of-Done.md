##Definition of done
The definition of done (DoD) is when **all conditions**, or **acceptance criteria**, that a software product must satisfy are met and ready to be accepted by a user, customer, team, or consuming system,”. We must meet the definition of done to ensure quality.

A typical definition of done consists of a checklist containing items such as:

1. Code for a work item is peer-reviewed
2. Code for a work item is checked in git version control
3. Change list (CL) is deployed to Quality Assurance (QA) environment 
4. Work item passes functional and automated tests
5. Code gets deployed to **production** (PRD) environment
6. Code does not generate system degradation

Different companies and development groups will come up with their own variant, but they all tack back to the **same ideal**: **the code does what it’s supposed to and doesn’t break anything else**.
