### Goals for this period

The following are the goals that were agreed upon for this period:

* Ship project Thanos successfully: hitting the deadline, and keeping quality high.
* Keep the code quality high on the team.
* Take on at least one public speaking engagement.
* Be involved in at least one [RFC discussion](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/scaling-engineering-teams-via-writing-things-down-rfcs/) outside the team.
* Mentor Alex on the team.
### My accomplishments

**I have hit all major goals set, but one:**

* Shipped project Thanos ahead of schedule. Thanos is expected to generate $3M in annual revenue. A few notable pull requests I made include [T84293](https://www.example.com/), [T23920](https://www.example.com/) and [T43908](https://www.engguidebook.com/)
* Improved our coding quality: both by formalizing coding guidelines, partially automating them through linting, and by pairing with people more often.
* I’ve reviewed and discussed 3 RFCs outside the team ([Zeo RFC](https://example.com/), [Payback RFC](https://example.com/) and [ some some RFC](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/scaling-engineering-teams-via-writing-things-down-rfcs/)) 
* Mentored Alex throughout the period, and I’m seeing good growth from him.
* I did not do a public talk, deciding to focus on Thanos instead, given its business impact. However, I have helped Alex prepare for the university presentation.

**Additional achievements:**

* Jumped in and shipped the Payback project, working with 3 other engineers on another team. Payback is a strategic project and the #1 priority for the Payback team for this period.
  *  Sent weekly update emails to Payback stakeholders, jumping in for a few weeks, while the project lead was unexpectedly out (an example email)
* Drove the postmortem and improvements after the cache system outage. These changes should help us detect similar incidents in 5 minutes over 2 hours: resulting in an impact reduction of up to $20,000 per incident (the business impact of this incident was $22,000 in losses).
* Onboarded Sam to the team.
* Proposed architecture improvements to the Gamma system: this work is in our backlog for the next period. This work should accelerate the retirement of 50% of the current Gamma infrastructure.
* Pushed 136 pull requests and did 180 code reviews in this period.
* Did 19 interviews (10 phone screens, 9 architecture ones)

### How I worked with others

I try to put the team and others ahead of myself: this is how I feel I can help the team the most. A few highlights in this area:

* I kept the coding quality high, through thorough code reviews. Examples of high-quality code reviews include:
  *  T23423: pointing out tests that don’t do what they are expected to do
  *  T74382: pushing back on an inbound, low-quality code change coming in from another team
  *  T38493: giving feedback to Sam on our coding style (note: I later followed up in person)
* Alex has been giving me very positive feedback and said that my support means a lot to him in growing. I try to prepare ideas and suggestions for our catch-ups, and pair with him on code reviews when I have the time.
* I spent considerable time onboarding Sam. He had issues with his setup and his first few commits: I paired with him more frequently than I planned to. This seems to have paid off, as he’s now just as productive as any team member.
* I’m a frequent point of contact for team stakeholders. Our data scientist (John) and engineers from the Payback and Chat team (Zeno, Emily, and Tom) frequently directly ping me for questions and we have a good relationship.
* Though I did no public speaking myself, I mentored Alex to prepare for the university talk - that went very well.
* I received numerous thank you messages from within, and outside the team:
  *  Emily from the Chat team: “Thank you, for helping us out with the last-minute debugging and deployment. You make yourself available made it possible to hit our deadline, despite the last-minute issues.”
  *  John: “I want to send a quick thanks for how much you’re helping me with analytics queries. Keep it up!”

### Levels and competencies assessment

Here are my thoughts on the expectations and competencies for the past period.
* **Overall**: I feel I’ve made strong progress towards exceeding what is expected at my level. I’ll be curious to hear observations and feedback on where I am.

* **Software engineering:** I focused a lot on this area.
* **Collaboration:** I worked a lot with people from other teams: data science (John), Payback (Zeno), and Chat (Emily and Tom). I’ve also been involved in architecture discussions with 3 other teams.
* **Design and architecture:** I focused on this area for the period, expanding my involvement from beyond the team. The multiple, significant RFC contributions are a good example of this.
* **Results and impact:** I’ve been prioritizing business results, and the impact shows. All key projects were shipped on time or before. I achieved this by putting other priorities later: such as some of my citizenship commitments or delaying my public speaking engagement.
* **Citizenship:** I spent a lot of time mentoring and onboarding others. I did not put additional focus on this area, external to the company, though.
