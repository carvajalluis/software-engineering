# Guidelines & FAQ

The Engineering Competency Matrix is part of a larger ecosystem around career growth, learning, and career development. Monthly 1:1s between an engineer and their manager, regular feedback and conversations about alignment and growth, as well as quarterly goal-setting and feedback sessions, and annual performance reviews complement the competency matrix.

# Competency Matrix Goals

1. Give engineers a career perspective and map of progress.
2. Provide a framework for performance evaluation and feedback.
3. Inform our hiring.

# Guidelines 

The competency matrix outlines expectations and examples of an engineer’s competencies and responsibilities at every level. It’s the basis for discussions between an engineer and their manager(s), and the basis for feedback between teammates. We assume that engineers demonstrate competencies within their role and work area and are provided opportunities to demonstrate certain competencies. We also assume that this role, area of work, and these opportunities may bring constraints that may impact this ability to demonstrate certain competencies.

### Levels

 * Levels are absolute. Each level stands for itself.
 * Levels E1-E3 generally focus on engineers executing work.
 * Levels E4-E6 generally focus on mentoring and guiding others in their work. 

### Competencies and scaling

* Competencies scale through areas of influence/impact (own work on task epic project/milestone/team across teams engineering organization company)
* Competencies scale through increased frequency (sometimes usually always demonstrating a competency)
* Some competencies only scale through a limited number of levels, e.g. because we don’t expect Junior Engineers / Interns to practice them yet, or because they hit a growth limit at a certain point.

### Demonstrating competencies at different levels

Growth is not linear or streamlined, therefore we expect that engineers will demonstrate competencies at different levels (e.g. demonstrate debugging skills at E4, and security skills at E1). We’re addressing this as follows:

1. The competency matrix is not a checklist, it’s a guideline, and smaller deviations are to be expected. If overall growth is visible, such deviations will not stand in the way of promotions.
2. We’ll use a numeric system to turn feedback into ratings and be able to account for and even out deviations.
3. Practically addressing deviations:

  *  Larger gaps and deviations beyond the  -1 level from an engineer’s current level should be used as a basis for discussions with their manager about growth opportunities and what the organization can do to support this person in leveling up.
  *  Deviations beyond the +1 level from an engineer’s current level should be used to discuss how the engineer can use these particular strengths for further growth and supporting others, e.g. through mentoring.

### Additional organizational support

The Organization want to support all engineers in their growth and development of competencies.  We encourage everyone to speak about details with their manager, who will support them in this as well.

# glossary of terms

### task

 A single, discrete, piece of engineering work that maps to a single issue.

### epic

A discrete piece of business value that can be described as one or more user stories. Epics are broken down into tasks. 

### project

A grouping of values is made up of one or more epics. Examples: Performance Pricing or End of Life.

### team, teammates

The group that someone is a part of and working with on a regular basis, including other engineers, embedded SRE, their manager, and the product manager working with them.

### across teams

Doing work that affects multiple teams; not necessarily communication that affects multiple teams.

### engineering organization

All members of the engineering department, including engineers, managers, embedded SREs, and product managers work directly with teams.

### business stakeholders

Everyone at the organization who’s not a teammate has a vested interest in the work of the team. This could include other departments (sales,
finance) or other engineering teams (ie: if you are on a tooling team like Backplane).

### domain

Area of work that someone and their team are regularly engaged in.

### frequency

##### sometimes

Occasionally.

##### usually

Most of the time.

##### always

Consistently, all the time.
